The AI engineer's work on Neon Trader V7 has progressed from initial concept clarification to building a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The trajectory covers iterative feature development, UI enhancements, and critical security overhauls. Initially, the focus was on establishing a multi-page frontend with a Dark Glassy theme and RTL support, coupled with a backend for simulated trading, real market data integration, and AI-driven plans. A significant pivot occurred to implement a robust JWT-based authentication system due to identified vulnerabilities. Subsequently, the engineer has been transforming dummy functionalities (like market data, trading tools, and settings) into real, interactive features, constantly addressing user feedback regarding the application's realism. The current work involves developing real interactive charts and a functional settings page, requiring both frontend and backend updates.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to create Neon Trader V7, an AI-driven personal trading manager that provides daily plans, identifies trading opportunities with explanations, and requires user approval for execution. It must support crypto, forex, and stocks via a unified, transparent interface for stable additional income. Key UI pages include Home, Platforms, AI Assistant, Settings, Trading Tools, and Smart Notifications, all adhering to a Dark Glassy theme, Tajawal font, RTL, and mobile-first design. Core engine requirements include real market data, simulated (and later, real) trading with risk management. Security features initially included auto-lock/session timeout and distinct Power lock vs. Logout. Later requests expanded to responsive navigation, full real trading capabilities across all asset types, 2FA, and dedicated, interactive Trading Tools (technical analysis, Japanese candlesticks) and Smart Notifications for market alerts and trade advice. The application requires a robust, backend-driven security system. The overall goal is to transition from mock-up functionalities to a fully realistic and interactive trading platform.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: The primary FastAPI application file, consolidating all backend logic. It includes API endpoints for portfolio, trades, platforms, AI analysis, daily plans, market data, and smart notifications. It integrates with MongoDB (Motor),  (LLM), and  (trading).
    -   *Changes*: Heavily modified to implement JWT-based authentication (user models, hashing, token management, securing routes). It now uses  (initially, then faced rate limits) and  for market data, and includes fixes for smart notifications.
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to include To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , , , , , , , .
-   ****: Backend environment variables.
    -   *Importance*: Stores , , , and .
    -   *Changes*:  was fetched and moved here.
-   ****: Main React component for global state, routing, and authentication.
    -   *Changes*: Modified to integrate JWT authentication, managing user state, tokens, and handling login/logout flows.
-   ****: Handles user login/registration.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to use new JWT-based backend endpoints for authentication.
-   ****: Displays user info and navigation.
    -   *Changes*: Modified to display dynamic user info from JWT context.
-   ****: Displays AI plans.
    -   *Changes*: Updated API calls to use authenticated endpoints.
-   ****: For trading analysis tools.
    -   *Changes*: Transformed from a dummy page to include interactive charting () and a functional risk calculator. Fixed React Hooks errors.
-   ** (NEW)**: Renders real, interactive candlestick charts.
    -   *Summary*: This new file is essential for providing actual market study capabilities within Trading Tools.
-   ****: Current dummy settings page.
    -   *Summary*: This file contains the placeholder UI for settings.
-   ** (NEW)**: Being created for a functional settings page.
    -   *Summary*: This new file is intended to replace the dummy settings, allowing users to save and manage application configurations persistently.
-   ****: Frontend environment variables.
    -   *Importance*: Crucial for  for backend communication.
-   ****: Frontend JavaScript dependencies.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to include , , , , , , .

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently engaged in a comprehensive effort to transform the Neon Trader V7 from a largely dummy application into a fully functional, real-time trading platform, directly addressing user feedback that many functionalities remained static or fake. A recent assessment revealed that only 44.4% of the application's features were truly operational, with critical areas like market data, trading tools, and settings still needing real implementation.

The immediate focus has two main tracks:
1.  **Developing Real Interactive Charts**: This involves replacing static graphical representations with dynamic, data-driven charts in the Trading Tools section. Frontend packages (, ,  libraries) have been installed, and a new component, , has been created. The  component is being updated to integrate this new charting functionality.
2.  **Implementing a Real Settings Page**: Recognizing the existing settings page is non-functional, a new component, , has been created. The engineer's very next step is to develop the corresponding backend API endpoints to allow users to save and retrieve their actual preferences, making the settings persistent and impactful.

This work follows significant prior progress, including the successful implementation of a robust JWT-based authentication system across both backend and frontend, the integration of real (though rate-limited) market data sources like CoinGecko and ExchangeRate API, and fixing critical bugs in smart notifications. The core challenge now is to infuse real-time interactivity and persistence into previously static or unimplemented application sections.
